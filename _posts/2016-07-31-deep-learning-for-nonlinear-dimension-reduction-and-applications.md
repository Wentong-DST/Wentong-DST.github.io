I spent a significant proportion of my summer holidays completing yet another undergraduate research project (UROPS) in NUS, this time under the supervision of [<u>Alexandre Thiery</u>](http://www.normalesup.org/~athiery/). The topic was on deep learning and applications; following recent papers/articles (see references) concerning classification problems, autoencoders and modelling uncertainty in neural networks.

Here's my [<u>UROPS paper</u>](/pdf/st3288.pdf "st3288.pdf") summarizing the project, as well as links to my relevant code repositories:

* [<u>iris-classification</u>](https://github.com/mollymr305/iris-classification)
* [<u>stochastic-depth</u>](https://github.com/mollymr305/stochastic-depth)
* [<u>mnist-classification</u>](https://github.com/mollymr305/mnist-classification)
* [<u>mnist-autoencoder</u>](https://github.com/mollymr305/mnist-autoencoder)
* [<u>mnist-mc-dropout</u>](https://github.com/mollymr305/mnist-mc-dropout)

This was actually my first time doing anything related to machine learning. I was always aware of the field, but never really studied it in detail. Overall, I'm really quite amazed at all advancements in this field so far.
