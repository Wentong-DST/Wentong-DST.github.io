I am a final year undergraduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Just some thoughts on mathematics, statistics and computer science - often inspired by conversations with friends, or whatever I am currently working on. All posts dated Jun 1, 2016 are older blog posts (on wordpress).

Also a dumping ground for some of my (future) projects.
